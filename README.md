# Sapeint's Virtual Shell (SVSH)
 This is a 'mock-os' created as a sort of 'Virtual Shell', that manages things.

The main goal is to be able to do the following:
- Extend the shell through programming (mainly C)
- Have it's own 'Psuedo-Filesystem'
- Have it be multi-user
- Have it implement a POSIX-like Shell for interaction

### Features  
- Currently it does nothing beyond set itself up a little.

## QnA  
### Why did you write this?  
I was in a discord where another user was in a code jam and had to write this in Node. I thought it was an intersting idea and so I started to write it in C.

### Why did you use C?  
Because, while I know Python 3, I figured it would be a nice challenge, and also help me get better at C.

### Should I use this at all?  
No! Not at all!

### Can I run this?  
Yes! Should you, see the Question `Should I use this at all?`

### I'm going to use this! Can I package it?
Uh sure, I just have one question for you....**WHY?????**.

### Why the MIT (Expat) License?  
This is just a fun little project of mine, and I doubt anything here could really be used that much outside of it. However if someone manages that, well then congrats to them.

I would like to be informed if you use something from here though.
